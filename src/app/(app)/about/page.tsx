                    Our Story: From Setbacks to Strength
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
                    In 2020, <span className="font-bold italic">my journey to fitness</span> started under less-than-ideal circumstances. I was in a tough spot - <span className="font-bold italic">recovering from a breakup, feeling skinny fat, and unhappy</span> with how I looked and felt. My energy was low, my confidence was lower, and I knew <span className="font-bold italic">something had to change</span>.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
                    I took my first step toward transformation by <span className="font-bold italic">hiring a personal trainer</span>. It was an investment, and while I learned a lot, I found myself <span className="font-bold italic">yearning for more</span> advanced exercises and methods. I dove into the vast library of YouTube fitness channels, soaking up the expertise of bodybuilders and fitness influencers. Slowly but surely, I started building muscle, learning to control my nutrition, and shedding fat.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
                    When my career began in 2021, <span className="font-bold italic">life became busier</span>. The demands of work meant less time for the gym, and while I stayed consistent, I found myself <span className="font-bold italic">hitting a plateau</span>. Progress slowed, and I started to <span className="font-bold italic">feel stuck</span> - something I knew many people experience when balancing fitness with real-life responsibilities.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
                    In 2022, a heavy squatting session led to a <span className="font-bold italic">knee injury: a torn meniscus</span>. The injury was a significant setback, both physically and mentally. I lost muscle mass in my legs and felt demotivated about training. The gym, which had been my sanctuary, became a source of frustration.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
                    But <span className="font-bold italic">every setback is an opportunity for a comeback</span>. In 2023, <span className="font-bold italic">I channeled my passion for fitness</span> and my experiences into something bigger - <span className="font-bold italic">Proxima Fitness</span>. I wanted to create a platform that would help intermediate lifters, like myself, push through plateaus, manage the challenges of work-life balance, and continue progressing even when life throws curveballs.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
                    Fast forward to 2025, and <span className="font-bold italic">Proxima Fitness has officially launched</span>. As I prepare for <span className="font-bold italic">knee surgery</span>, Iâ€™m excited to recover and rebuild with the very tools Iâ€™ve helped create. Proxima isnâ€™t just a product; itâ€™s the culmination of years of hard work, learning, and overcoming obstacles.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-8 mt-4">
                    This journey has been about <span className="font-bold italic">more than just getting jacked - itâ€™s been about resilience, adaptation, and sharing the lessons Iâ€™ve learned with others</span> who are ready to <span className="font-bold italic">transform their own lives</span>.
                </p>
